                        Our Story
                    </h3>
                    <p>Scheduling is a nightmare. We know because we’ve lived it.</p>
                    <p>We’ve seen managers spend their entire Monday morning buried in spreadsheets, juggling text messages, and trying to solve an impossible puzzle: "Anna can't work Fridays, Mark needs mornings off for classes, and we still need three people on shift for the evening rush."</p>
                    <p>The result? Hours of wasted time, frustrated managers, and a schedule that leaves half the team unhappy.</p>
                    <p>We knew there had to be a better way.</p>                
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Our Mission
                    </h3>
                    <p>Our mission is simple: to make complex scheduling effortless.</p>
                    <p>We created FreeSchedule to transform one of the most stressful weekly tasks into a fast, automated, and intelligent process. We believe technology should do the heavy lifting, not you.</p>
                    <p>Our platform isn't just about filling slots. It’s about creating optimal schedules. We built a smart engine that listens to both sides—it respects the manager's business needs and fairly incorporates the constraints of every employee.</p>
                    <p>We empower managers to build fair, balanced, and efficient schedules in minutes, not hours.</p>                 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>
                        Our Vision
                    </h3>
                   <p>We envision a future where work-life balance isn't just a buzzword, but is built directly into the operational fabric of every team. We believe that happy, respected employees build the strongest businesses. By eliminating the friction of scheduling, we’re helping create happier, more productive, and more engaged workplaces.</p>
